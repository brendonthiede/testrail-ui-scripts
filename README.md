UI Scripts for modifying TestRail behavior

## Usage

For using TestRail UI scripts, see the documentation here: [UI Scripts: Introduction](http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-custom/uiscripts-introduction)

## Test It Out

You're paying money to use a test management system, so I hope that means that you take testing seriously. With that in mind, make sure you test the scripts out before publicizing and relying on them, as they were developed against what was the current version of TestRail in 2017.
